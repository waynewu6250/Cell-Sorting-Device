# Cell-Sorting-Device
The graduate research project of a microfluidics particle-analyzing device based on impedance sensing <br>

### Type Differentiation
With the proposed device, we collected different signal data with unknown types of beads and cells; our task is to use machine learning algorithm to classify or make clusters of different beads based on their properties and signals.

* First approach: naive-bayes generative modeling with bivariate guassian models.
* Second approach: Bayesian unsupervised learning: Guassian Mixed models.
* Third approach: K-means algorithm
* Four approach: Deep neural network from scratch
